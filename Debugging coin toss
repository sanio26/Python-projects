Bugs in the orginal code:
import random
guess = '' 
while guess not in ('heads', 'tails'):
    print('Guess the coin toss! Enter heads or tails:')
    guess = input()

toss = random.randint(0, 1)  # 0 is tails, 1 is heads

if toss == guess:  # ❌ Bug 1
    print('You got it!')
else:
    print('Nope! Guess again!')
    guesss = input()  # ❌ Bug 2
    if toss == guess:  # ❌ Bug 3
        print('You got it!')
    else:
        print('Nope. You are really bad at this game.')

corrected code:
import random

# Get the user's first guess
guess = ''
while guess not in ('heads', 'tails'):
    print('Guess the coin toss! Enter heads or tails:')
    guess = input().lower()

# Simulate the coin toss
toss = random.randint(0, 1)  # 0 is tails, 1 is heads

# Convert toss to string for comparison
toss_result = 'heads' if toss == 1 else 'tails'

# First attempt
if toss_result == guess:
    print('You got it!')
else:
    print('Nope! Guess again!')
    guess = ''
    while guess not in ('heads', 'tails'):
        guess = input().lower()
    if toss_result == guess:
        print('You got it!')
    else:
        print('Nope. You are really bad at this game.')
